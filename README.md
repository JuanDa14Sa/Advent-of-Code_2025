# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles.

## Repository Structure

Each day has its own folder containing:
- `solver.py` — The solution script
- `input.txt` — The puzzle input for that day

```
Day 1/
  ├── solver.py
  └── input.txt
Day 2/
  ├── solver.py
  └── input.txt
...
```

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
python "Day <N>/solver.py"
```
## Notes

- Each solution reads its input from `input.txt` in the same directory.
- Solutions are meant to be run from the repository root or their own directory.
